	abstract = {A new set of tools, including controller scaling, controller parameterization and practical optimization, is presented to standardize controller tuning. Controller scaling is used to frequency-scale an existing controller for a large class of plants, eliminating the repetitive controller tuning process for plants that differ mainly in gain and bandwidth. Controller parameterization makes the controller parameters a function of a single variable, the loop-gain bandwidth, and greatly simplifies the tuning process. Practical optimization is defined by maximizing the bandwidth subject to the physical constraints, which determine the limiting factors in performance. Collectively, these new tools move controller tuning in the direction of science.},

  abstract = {The use of a brushless (BLDC) motor is growing with the popularity of robotic and electric vehicles. This motor wiring and electronics need more connection compared to other types. This research provides an integration 3-phase inverter with a microcontroller with wireless connection capabilities to control the BLDC motor. So, the user can command the motor wirelessly with reduced connection and wiring. Opensource library SimpleFOC is used to accommodate the control system. In this study, we had conducted a performance test for BLDC motors when using wireless integration capability. It includes the performance of velocity control and position control for three different BLDC motors. The result shows that the wireless integration system can deliver 200 rad/s for velocity control using a 24V voltage source. With this research, we have proposed the use of wireless integration to simplify the wiring, connection, and control process for BLDC motors.},

  abstract = {Since permanent magnet direct current (DC) motors are mainly used in various industrial automation applications, the demand for electric motors is increasing rapidly. However, in the mass production of electric motors, often, only random inspections are used to check the specifications and performance of electric motors. For manufacturing or engineering application staff to have a more thorough understanding of the characteristics of the motor, it is necessary to conduct a full or quick inspection during the production process to ensure the quality of the electric motor. Based on this, this literature review reveals several methods and algorithms often used to estimate DC motor parameters, given the importance of knowing the parameters of the DC motor and the lack of research on estimating the parameters of the DC motor.},

  abstract = {In high-performance control of ac machines through variable frequency drives, the knowledge of machine parameters plays a decisive role. The accuracy with which machine parameters can be known is directly related to the time and effort put during the testing and commissioning process. In the ever-demanding industrial environments, the time spent on parameter identification translates into loss of production. To reduce commissioning times, research in this direction has focused on automatizing the identification procedure without loss of accuracy. This paper reviews different lines of research adopted over the past few decades for machine parameter identification. Parameter estimation of ac machines is considered because of their widespread applications from servomechanisms to traction to aviation. The surveyed works include self-commissioning schemes that have become an integral part and a salient feature of modern electric drives. This feature enables the drives to automatically identify machine parameters and tune the control loops.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a parameter formula connecting the well-known proportional-integralderivative (PID) control and the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC). On the one hand, this formula gives a quantitative lower bound to the bandwidth of the extended state observer (ESO) used in ADRC, implying that the ESO is not necessarily of high gain. On the other hand, enlightened by the design of ADRC, a new PID tuning rule is provided, which can guarantee both strong robustness and nice tracking performance of the closed-loop systems under the PID control. Moreover, it is proved that the ESO can be rewritten as a suitable linear combination of the three terms in PID, which can give a better estimate for the system uncertainty than the single integral term in the PID controller. Theoretical results are verified also by simulations in the paper.},

  abstract = {A nonlinear observer for surface-mount permanentmagnet synchronous motors (SPMSMs) was recently proposed by Ortega et al. (LSS, Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex, France, LSS Internal Rep., Jan. 2009). The nonlinear observer generates the position estimate θˆ via the estimates of sin θ and cos θ. In contrast to Luenberger-type observers, it does not require speed information, thus eliminating the complexity associated with speed estimation errors. Further, it is simple to implement. In this study, the nonlinear observer performance is verified experimentally. To obtain speed estimates from the position information, a proportionalintegral (PI) tracking controller speed estimator was utilized. The results are good with and without loads, above 10 r/min.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the state-of-the-art back electromotive force (EMF) based sensorless schemes for synchronous machines. Field-oriented control (FOC) of a synchronous machine requires real-time rotor position for decoupled torque and flux control. Extraction of rotor position without a sensor or sensorless control has been an enabling technology for the past few decades. Sensorless control using back EMF voltage induced by rotor movement is the most widely used method. However, the connections and differences between different methods have not been thoroughly investigated and documented. This article first reviews basic sensorless methods. The two implementation forms of an observer are examined to facilitate analysis. A detailed analysis puts in evidence the connections behind different methods in both stationary and synchronous reference frames. A summary is drawn that is meant to offer a few key points regarding different sensorless methods. Finally, a conclusion is given to summarize the major contributions of this article.},
